# file-system-checker
Common error checker for a custom file-system. Not pushing the file-system here :) If you need that, email me.

Somewhere in there there is code for PFF(Page fault frequency) and VSWS(Variable interval sampled working set strategy). Sorry for not creating a new one for this :)
